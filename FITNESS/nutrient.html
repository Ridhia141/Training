        <h2> Start with Whole-Grain cereal </h2><br>
        <p> A whole-grain consists of all edible parts of the grain encompassing the bran, germ and endosperm. The whole grain should be used intact and all elements should be present in original proportions. Grains are the seeds of plants called cereals, some of the most common types include corn, rice and wheat. While there are seeds of non-grass plants or pseudo-cereals that are also considered as whole grains including buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth.</p>

        <h2> Black Bean Burger  </h2><br>
        <p> One of the key nutrition facts about black bean burgers is their high protein content. Black beans are a great source of plant-based protein, making them an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans looking to add more protein to their diet. In fact, a single black bean burger patty can provide around 15 grams of protein, helping to fuel your body and support muscle growth and repair.</p>

        <h2> A Bowl of Berries </h2><br>
        <p> Blackberries contain a profuse amount of powerful antioxidants which may protect the body in multiple ways. Components such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and flavonols, particularly anthocyanosides, present in blackberries work against the harmful oxygen-free molecules and counteract their action. This protective radical scavenging activity protects the body from a range of diseases caused as a consequence of oxidative damage which may be the underlying cause of many fatal conditions. Researcher Wang SY of Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in a study has concluded blackberries to have the third-highest ORAC oxygen radical absorbance capacity (antioxidant capacity) fruit, following strawberries and black raspberries.</p>
