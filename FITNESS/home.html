        <h2> What is a bodyweight workout? </h2><br>
         <p> Bodyweight exercises (also called bodyweight workouts) are strength training exercises that use an individual's own weight to provide resistance against gravity.Bodyweight exercises can enhance a range of biomotor abilities including strength, power, endurance, speed, flexibility, coordination and balance.Such strength training has become more popular among recreational and professional athletes.Bodyweight training uses simple abilities like pushing, pulling, squatting, bending, twisting and balancing. Movements such as the push-up, the pull-up, and the sit-up are among the most common bodyweight exercises.Full body workouts are one of the most efficient and effective types of training, whether you’re performing them with barbells, dumbbells, or even full body workouts at home with no equipment at all.Some people are surprised to find that it’s possible to maintain and even improve their physiques, and they don’t need a bro split program or a classic PPL routine. For folks with a busy schedule, a full body workout programs are time efficient and can cut your training days down to as low as 3 days per week. Full body training programs are ideal for the beginner lifter or for anyone involved in other athletic activities.Not all full body workouts are created the same. If you’ve never performed or tried to create one, you might not know what to look for in a full body workout.</p>

         <h2> What type of training should I do lose weight?</h2><br>
         <p>When you think about the best type of workouts for weight loss, your mind might not immediately jump to strength training, but it should. While it’s definitely true that cardio workouts get your heart working harder and as a result, help your body burn calories, strength training is what’s really going to give your weight-loss goals that extra boost.Before we really get into it, we want to make it clear that weight loss as a goal isn't necessarily for everyone. For anyone who has a history of disordered eating, even if you're in recovery, you should speak with a doctor before you pursue any weight-loss goal, including starting a new exercise routine. And even if you don't have a history of disordered eating, it's really important to have realistic expectations and make sure you're pursuing weight loss in a healthy way. Results can be incredibly difficult to come by, may take a very long time to achieve, and are also really hard to maintain. Also important to remember: Exercise is only part of the equation. You have to create a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you consume in a day) in order to lose weight, which requires not just working out, but also being cognizant about what you’re eating, making sure to eat quality calories and watch portion sizes. You need to get good sleep, regularly. You need to have lowered stress levels. You need to take care of your other bodily needs. With so many factors at play, it's no wonder weight loss is a very unique experience for every person. If weight loss is a goal of yours, incorporating strength training into your routine is key. Here’s the thing, while strength training may not give you the instant heart-pounding, sweat-dripping satisfaction of, say, Zumba or an indoor cycling class, in the long run, building lean muscle definitely works in favor of your weight-loss goals. The short version? Having more muscle means your body burns more calories at rest. The long version? Read on for more on why strength training is the best exercise for weight loss.</p>
