        <h2>Bridge</h2><br>
        <p>The bridge exercise is a back bend, a core strengthener, and a balance pose all in one. The regular bridge exercise requires you to move your hips up toward the ceiling, while the yoga bridge pose requires you to extend your rib cage closer to your front body. Whichever form of the bridge you choose, though, you'll be getting a great workout for your hips, glutes, core, and hamstrings. If you want to know how to do the bridge exercise, see Step 1 to get started. It's recommended that you use a yoga mat for this exercise, but any padded floor will do. You don't want to hurt yourself by doing the bridge on a hard surface. As you lie down, make sure to keep your knees bent and hip distance apart, and the soles of your feet planted firmly on the floor.</p>

        <h2> Knee push-up </h2><br>
        <p> Knee push-ups are most often included into novice calisthenics training programs, but may also see use in cases where more advanced athletes desire further push-up volume without the same level of resistance.In order to maximize the benefits they receive from this particular kind of modified push-up, calisthenics athletes and other types of bodyweight exercise practitioners will program it as one of the first exercises within the workout â€“ or what is otherwise known as being a primary compound exercise.</p>

        <h2> Wall Squat</h2>
        <p> A wall squat, also known as a wall sit, is a bodyweight exercise that targets muscles in your core and lower body. To practice a wall squat, start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart and back flat against a wall. Lower into a seated position by bending your knees at a 90-degree angle. Keep your lower back firmly against the wall and hold the position for a set length of time. If the exercise proves to be too strenuous, you can alleviate the tension on your low back by practicing a variation known as an exercise ball wall squat. In this variation, the same steps are followed, but an exercise ball or stability ball is placed between your lower back and the wall. If you're looking to up the intensity of the workout, consider practicing a single-leg wall sit or a weighted dumbbell wall sit.</p>
